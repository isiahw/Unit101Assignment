Airborne School is where soliders become paratroopers and jump out of planes, with about three weeks of training.</p>
    
    <p> My first duty station was located in Florida and I was stationed there for about four years. Being stationed in FLorida was a <del>differnt experience</del> but the city had its pros and cons. A big pro was being <i>locted near</i> many beaches, that my wife and kids would enjoy going to. A big con for me, was the travel time to and from work. The military base was only about 15 miles away from our house, but it took about 40 mins to arrive.
